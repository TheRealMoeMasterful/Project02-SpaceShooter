# Project02-SpaceShooter

# Project Name
A shooting game with a spaceship and asteroids and big evil ships that you must DESTROY!

## Implementation
For extra points, I did the following:
-I used different assets from the excercises, which I found on OpenGameArt.com
-I created multiple enemy types: both the flying sine wave ships used in our excercises, as well as a large ship that drifts slowly across the screen from bottom to top, shifting to the left each time. Touching it kills you.
-I added a background image.
-I also felt that the turning was a little stiff so I created my own control scheme where the player uses the mouse to turn. The ship constantly faces the cursor and moves towards it. It's very janky, but I think its kind of fun!

I'm not sure what to put here but it feels like an appropriate place to link all the assets I used.
